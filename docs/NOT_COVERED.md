I list the features I won't cover here:
* number: JS number is actually a union of int and float. It is not easy to handle this one, so I treat number as int for now. This will change once I implement union type.
* class
* prototype
* this keyword
* label statement: goto is evil
* IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
